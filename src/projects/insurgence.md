<div class='project-page-card'>Starting in 2015, and all the way through 2020 and beyond, I was the lead developer and programmer behind the fan-project Pokémon Insurgence. This was a fangame, a passion project making no money to give fans of the franchise a chance to play more games.</div>

<p>
In development, I lead a small team of programmers, artists, musicians, and testers as we worked to create the game over the course of a few years (until 2020-ish, some time after the game's final release, where I gave up control of maintenance to a fellow team member). 
</p>
<p>
Compared to rival projects, the game sported a plethora of features: live online player-vs-player battles, challenge modes, analytics, unique battle types, 3D camera movement, and custom enemy AI.

<p>The game took off, gathering over 1,000,000 unique players over a couple years, and created vibrant an active Discord and forum communities around the game- from fanart to statistical analysis about optimal strategies in battle.</p>


<p>At the time, it was immensely possible, with it was one of the most popular fangames like it at its time, with YouTube <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6cHaqOb96I'>playthroughs</a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fijEKMgnyjI'>regularly</a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJkBYeG5_vU'>racking</a> up millions of views. At time, it was considered to be one of the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zptti2kJpk'>top</a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9clurECR-Cg&t'>fangames to play</a> (though looking back on it- the writing certainly shows its age and edginess).
